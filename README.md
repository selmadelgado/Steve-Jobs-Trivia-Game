## Project Description

1. A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

2. If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- this is done without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

     - If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display
     the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

     - If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected 
     the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few
     seconds, then show the next question.

4. The final screen displays the number of correct answers, incorrect answers and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
